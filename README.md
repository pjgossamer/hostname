# hostname
Simple C++ app to display the hostname IP Address

## Compiling hostname

Users on Linux and Windows compile hostname relatively the same. The required files below are needed for compiling the application:

* `bash` (Basic shell, used in a majority of major distributions)
* `g++` (The GNU C++ Chain Compiler)
* `git` (Git manages git projects)
* `make` (Used for automatic compilation of the project)

### Linux:

Start by cloning the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/pjgossamer/hostname.git
```

Then CHDIR into the location and do:

```
make
```

File will output into the `build`.

### Windows:

Make sure the above applications are installed (`g++` is supplied by `gcc-g++`). Then clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/pjgossamer/hostname.git
```

CHDIR into the location and do:

```
make
```
